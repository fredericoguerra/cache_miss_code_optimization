# Cache Miss Reduction - Code Optimization
This project evaluates the cache miss reduction trought code optimization using two squared matrices multiplication.

Unnesting the loops showed a significant time reduction foy all matrices size evaluated. In the other hand, the merging array and loop exchange only showd differences when increasing the matrices size.
